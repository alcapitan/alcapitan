# Hello, welcome on my GitHub profile ! 👋

## Who am I ? 💁

I'm a french 19 years old developer in university as second-year.  
I am in coding since 2018. I am passionate about Linux and tech curiosities.  
Btw I'm about to leave for an Erasmus program in Belgium as a third-year. Later on in my studies, I want to specialize in software development and do a master's degree in both management and IT.  
Unfortunately, my Github isn't so active right now due to my time spent to my studies, consequently it mainly contains my old projects.  
But nowadays, I have a web server for my current projects. More info soon !  
My favorite quote is : _If you are against the world, then you are made to change the world. (Indian quote)_
