# Hello, welcome on my GitHub profile ! 👋

## Who am I ? 💁
I am 16 years old and I am living in France.  
My favorite quote is : _If you are against the world, then you are made to change the world. (Indian quote)_  
I've been a coder for around 2 years. I am passionate about Linux and about open-source in general.  
My main project is [ATUI](https://github.com/alcapitan/atui). It's a web library (like Bootstrap) to help me and you (later) to build websites.
